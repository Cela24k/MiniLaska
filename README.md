LASCA, sometimes called Laskers or Laska, is a very intriguing and exciting board game invented in 1911 by the great chess master Emanuel Lasker. At first sight the game resembles draughts (called checkers in the USA); it is played with draughts pieces on a chequered board, and the pieces move like draughtsmen.

However, the similarity ends there, and as the game proceeds the soldiers, as they are called, become stacked into columns, sometimes containing the other playerâ€™s soldiers as prisoners underneath. Soldiers are promoted to officers, or are captured, and soon a violent battle rages on the board, with many possibilities for subtle strategies and tactics.
